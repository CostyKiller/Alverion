 * Reads the HTML of a townsperson's dialog into lines of runs a widget can lay out.
 * One reader serves every dialog: it knows tags, never a particular townsperson or page.
 * It reads text, line breaks, paragraphs, centering, font colours, a title, tables as plain lines, character entities, and the links and buttons that send a command or ask for another page.
 * It also reads entry boxes, multi-line boxes and drop-down lists, whose values fill the $name variables in a command, and images, which are read as their size only.
 * It ignores everything else, such as bold and italic.
